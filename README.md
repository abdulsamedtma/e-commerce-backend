## Overview

Welcome to the E-Commerce Back End project! This application serves as the foundation for powering an internet retail company's e-commerce website using modern technologies. Leveraging Express.js and Sequelize, we have built a robust back-end system that interacts seamlessly with a MySQL database.

The e-commerce industry plays a pivotal role in the electronics sector, enabling businesses and consumers to engage in convenient online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the e-commerce industry in the United States alone generated an estimated $2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. To compete effectively in this dynamic market, companies need cutting-edge technological solutions, and that's precisely what this project aims to deliver.

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company, the goal is clear: to have a back end for the e-commerce website that harnesses the latest technologies. This technology-driven approach enables your company to stay competitive and thrive alongside other e-commerce giants.

## Features

### Database Configuration

- Store your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password securely in an environment variable file, ensuring the security of your application's sensitive data.

### Database Initialization

- With just a few commands, you can create a development database and populate it with essential test data. Our initialization process ensures that your database is ready for action.

### Server Initialization

- Invoking the application launches your server, automatically syncing Sequelize models with the MySQL database. This ensures your data models perfectly match the database structure.

### API Endpoints

- Our application provides user-friendly API endpoints for categories, products, and tags. You can access these endpoints to retrieve data, a key component of any successful e-commerce platform.

### CRUD Operations

- Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes using popular tools like Insomnia. These routes empower you to create, update, and delete data in your database efficiently.
